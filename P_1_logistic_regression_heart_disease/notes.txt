If acuracy is 99%, it is not necessary that model is good. It is
based on business use case eg: if we predict 1000 are cancer free,
but 10 have cancer. here accuracy is 99% but 10 would have lost life
with our prediction


	# need info on what inference we get from model finally, if model not good what should be the next step
# we are taking random split and how each individual is having heart attack or not
